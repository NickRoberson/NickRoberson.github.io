        Welcome! <br><br>

        My name is Nick Roberson, and I am a fourth year Computer Science major at 
        Grinnell College in Iowa. A few months ago, as my senior year was approaching, 
        I had the idea to create a this site to better advertise myself to people and/or 
        employers. Here you can find information about where I’m from, what I like to 
        do, and what I’ve done in the past! Enjoy!

        <h4> 
          Film Photography
        </h4>
          <div class="content-item">
            One of the reasons that I like film so much is that, unlike taking photos 
            with my iPhone, every single shot requires more thought. The aperture, 
            focus, shutter speed, and zoom must be adjusted every time to get it just 
            right. This allows you to alter the color and lighting of every photo. This, 
            on top of the general feel and look of film photographs, gives each photo I 
            take an almost nostalgic look, adding an emotional layer to it that may be 
            lost in digital photographs. <br><br>

            I currently have three cameras, a Pentax K1000, Olympus OM10, and Minolta 
            MAXXUM 7000, and am looking to expand my collection in the future to 
            different makes and models. <br><br>

            Check out some of my photos right below! <br><br>

        <h4>Swimming & Water Polo</h4>
        <div class="content-item">
          Since the age of 6 I have always love swimming, it was not until college that I became involved with
          water polo.

        <h4>Music</h4>
          <div class="content-item">
          I really find it hard to hone in on one type of music that interests me. What 
          I wake up each day and want to listen to can vary more than the weather.  I 
          have gone from one-day listening to bluegrass, to US Top 50 on the next, to 
          early 2000’s Australian rap on the day after that. There doesn’t seem to be 
          any reason to the music I may be interested in on any given day. What I do 
          know, however, is that I can attribute the foundations of my taste in music to 
          my dad. Throughout my entire childhood he was constantly introducing me to new 
          music and expanding my horizons, playing anything from Jazz, to Rock, to Rap. 
          By the time I was 11, I must have heard it all.  <br><br>
          
          Earlier this summer I had the thought to combine my interests in music, art, 
          and computer science and start a side project. This inspiration took the form 
          of a <a id="website">website</a> that I am currently developing using the Spotify API and the data 
          visualization library D3.js. Its purpose is to allow Spotify users to visualize 
          the music that they listen to as well as explore new music. The visualizations 
          are done using graphs and charts created using data grabbed from your account 
          such as top songs, playlists, and artists. I’m a long way from finishing, but 
          it has been a really enjoyable project to work on and I have learned a lot along 
          the way. <br><br>

          I’m also really interested in producing music, just for fun, but there are 
          only so many hours in the day!
