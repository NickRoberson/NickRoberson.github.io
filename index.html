        Welcome! <br><br>

        My name is Nick Roberson, and I am a fourth year Computer Science major at 
        Grinnell College in Iowa. A few months ago, as my senior year was approaching, 
        I had the idea to create a this site to better advertise myself to people and/or 
        employers. Here you can find information about where I’m from, what I like to 
        do, and what I’ve done in the past! Enjoy! <br><br>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <br>
        Like I said before, I am a fourth year Computer Science major at Grinnell 
        College in Iowa, but this wasn’t always the plan. Upon leaving Northern 
        Virginia to go to the Midwest for college I had no intentions of majoring in 
        Computer Science. In fact, I wanted to do a Music/Physics double major. I 
        had played the trumpet my entire life and had a string of really enjoyable 
        physics classes in high school. Music and Physics seemed like a natural 
        path for me. I thought I had everything figured out. However, after taking 
        CSC 151 and 161 (the intro sequence at Grinnell) my first year, I realized 
        that I couldn’t have been more wrong. I found myself a new advisor, added 
        Computer Science as my major, and since then my major has taken me to some really
        sweet places. <br><br>

        In the summer of 2016, just after my second year, I was lucky enough to intern 
        at SRI in Menlo Park, CA in their Speech Technology and Research lab (S.T.A.R. Lab). I worked 
        on a web based application that would help native speakers of endangered 
        languages aid speech recognition software in learning/recognizing their 
        language. <br><br>

        Shortly after my time at SRI, in the fall of that same year, I was able to study 
        abroad in Budapest, Hungary at a <a href="http://www.ait-budapest.com/">Computer 
        Science and Math program</a>. There I met some of the most inspirational people 
        that I’m convinced I’ll ever meet. In addition, I was able to take a class in 
        Integer/Linear Programming, Graph Theory, as well as Android mobile development, 
        piquing my interest in all three fields. <br><br>

        Finally, this past summer I worked as a research/software-development intern 
        for the Grinnell College Computer Science Department doing research in the 
        realm of Molecular Computing. Together with my other interns/friends and our advisor, 
        Titus Klinge, we built the first IDE intended for the modular development of 
        chemical reaction networks (CRNs), <a href="http://www.dna.caltech.edu/Papers/programmability_of_CRNs_preprint2008.pdf">which in 2009 were proven to be Turing 
        universal</a>. Getting out of my comfort zone and diving into the field of 
        Molecular Computing was a phenomenal experience that lent me new skills and 
        knowledge. On top of that, I was able to advance my software development 
        skills by building an entire IDE. <br><br>
        
        As much as I would love to share an executable file for Caldron with everyone, I cannot. 
        Caldron is still in Alpha, not Beta yet, so it is not ready to be released to the public. 
        Once it is in Beta, there will be a link to an executable below in the project description.
        If you use it I would love some feedback, so shoot me an email, my address is listed below.
        Currently we are finalizing Caldron and drafting a paper to submit to 
        <a href="http://www.biostec.org/">BIOSTEC 2018</a> in Funchal, Madeira - 
        Portugal so we can go and give a talk on our work.

      <div class="content-item">
        There are many things that I find myself getting interested in, some academie and 
        some not, but I had to narrow it down. So here are three of my biggest 
        extracirricular time sinks. <br>
      </div>

      <!-- FILM PHOTOGRAPHY COLLAPSIBLE ITEM  -->

          <div id="filmPhotography" class="collapse">
            <div class="content-item">
              One of the reasons that I like film so much is that, unlike taking photos 
              with my iPhone, every single shot requires more thought. The aperture, 
              focus, shutter speed, and zoom must be adjusted every time to get it just 
              right. This allows you to alter the color and lighting of every photo. This, 
              on top of the general feel and look of film photographs, gives each photo I 
              take an almost nostalgic look, adding an emotional layer to it that may be 
              lost in digital photographs. <br><br>

              I currently have three cameras, a Pentax K1000, Olympus OM10, and Minolta 
              MAXXUM 7000, and am looking to expand my collection in the future to 
              different makes and models. <br><br>

            This year marks the 14th year that I have been swimming competitively. 
            I began swimming in the summers at my local pool when I was 8 and have 
            progressed over the years through different teams to where I am now, a 
            senior in college and the captain of the Grinnell College varsity swim 
            and water polo teams. <br><br>
            
            To say that swimming has not played a formative role in who I am today 
            would be an outright lie. Whether it was waking up at 3:50AM 4-to-5 times 
            a week for morning practice before school or leading my team as captain 
            to multiple state championships, swimming has taught me discipline, 
            leadership, and confidence. In addition to these lessons, some of the best 
            friends I have I owe entirely to swimming. It is a sport that brings people 
            together. Whether it be tiring and intense distance sets or 
            training-trip-two-a-days, mutual suffering in the form of athletics has 
            proven to be a fantastic bonding experience. <br><br>
        
            So while my future in swimming may be hazy, as I am not sure what to do 
            with it after graduation, I felt that it had to be included given its 
            impact on me as a person and its importance in my life thus far.

            I really find it hard to hone in on one type of music that interests me. What 
            I wake up each day and want to listen to can vary more than the weather.  I 
            have gone from one-day listening to bluegrass, to US Top 50 on the next, to 
            early 2000’s Australian rap on the day after that. There doesn’t seem to be 
            any reason to the music I may be interested in on any given day. What I do 
            know, however, is that I can attribute the foundations of my taste in music to 
            my dad. Throughout my entire childhood he was constantly introducing me to new 
            music and expanding my horizons, playing anything from Jazz, to Rock, to Rap. 
            By the time I was 11, I must have heard it all.  <br><br>
            
            Earlier this summer I had the thought to combine my interests in music, art, 
            and computer science and start a side project. This inspiration took the form 
            of a <a id="website">website</a> that I am currently developing using the Spotify API and the data 
            visualization library D3.js. Its purpose is to allow Spotify users to visualize 
            the music that they listen to as well as explore new music. The visualizations 
            are done using graphs and charts created using data grabbed from your account 
            such as top songs, playlists, and artists. I’m a long way from finishing, but 
            it has been a really enjoyable project to work on and I have learned a lot along 
            the way. <br><br>

            I’m also really interested in producing music, just for fun, but there are 
            only so many hours in the day!

          <div class="content-item">
            Over this past summer (2017) my teammates and I built an integrated development environment (IDE) for 
            modular chemical reaction network (CRNs) development called Caldron. Unlike existing tools that are 
            simulations tools, Caldron is first to help developers and researchers 
            develop and program CRNs in Caldron. Caldron supports I/O CRNs, 
            extension operators, and closed sub-CRNs in addition to common features 
            found in existing CRN tools. For example, users can divide a CRN into 
            independent modules, test them separately, and reuse them in other CRNs. 
            Furthermore, users can mark species as inputs and specify them with common 
            elementary functions, by drawing a function, or by connecting them to another 
            CRN. Many commonly used CRNs and extension operators are also included as 
            libraries in Caldron. <br><br>

            Currently, Caldron is still not ready to be released to the public, as we 
            are very focused on making Caldron accessible to everyone using any platform
            (Windows, MacOS, Linux). We believe accessibility is important to lower 
            the bar of entry to using CRNs as a programming language so that more 
            students and researchers can develop modular CRNs. Finally, we will polish 
            Caldron so that it is easy to use and intuitive. <br><br>
